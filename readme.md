# Tic Tac Toe Game

This project is part of The Odin Project's Advanced JavaScript Object-Oriented Programming curriculum. The goal is to build a browser-based Tic Tac Toe game.

## Learning Objectives

During this project, I will deepen my understanding of:

- **Objects** and their use in JavaScript
- **Factory functions** for creating game components
- **Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs)** and module patterns
- **Private variables** to encapsulate game state
- **Prototypal inheritance** for creating and managing game elements
- **Closures** to handle game logic and state management

## Features

- A playable Tic Tac Toe game directly in the browser
- Object-oriented design for game components
- Use of modern JavaScript features and best practices
